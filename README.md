# Covid-19-Data-Analysis

In this project, we aim to explore the potential relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and the happiness levels of people living in different countries. We will utilize two datasets: a COVID-19 dataset providing cumulative positive cases per day in various countries, and a Happiness Worldwide dataset containing scores on various life factors as reported by individuals in each country.

Datasets:

COVID-19 Dataset: This dataset provides daily updates on the cumulative number of positive COVID-19 cases in different countries. It includes information such as date, country, number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

Happiness Worldwide Dataset: This dataset measures happiness and well-being based on various factors such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. Each country is assigned scores for these factors based on surveys conducted among its residents
